# Robonato Typeface  

**Robonato** is a custom typeface that replaces each letter with its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet word. For example, typing "A" will render "Alpha," and typing "B" will render "Bravo."  

## Why NATO Alphabets?  

The NATO phonetic alphabet is an internationally recognized standard used to spell out words clearly and unambiguously over communication channels like radio or telephone. It ensures clarity, especially in noisy environments or situations where errors could have significant consequences, such as in aviation, military, and emergency services.

## About the Typeface  

I’ve always been fascinated by typography and recently learned about the NATO phonetic alphabet, which inspired me to create this typeface. **Robonato** uses **Roboto Mono** as its foundation, chosen for its simplicity, readability, and suitability for monospaced text applications.  

### Key Features:
- **Proportional Widths:** Each glyph is designed to accommodate the length of the NATO word it represents.
- **Based on Roboto Mono:** A widely used, highly legible monospaced font, perfect for this context.

## Where Can It Be Used?  

- Typographic experiments  
- Communication tools for NATO alphabet learners  
- Creative design projects
